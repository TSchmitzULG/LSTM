# LSTM
Learn and emulate nonlinear audio systems in real-time
Two jupyter notebook are used:
- Learn LSTM ICASSP is used to learn new model from a dataset
- Real-Time Emulation of LSTM is used to emulate the model in real time by applying it on input guitar signal.
Clone the git directory to your computer and launch the notebook ".ipynb" file. 
Don't forget to install the required libraries (tensorflow,cuda,numpy,matplotlib,pyaudio,...).

if you do not want to use notebook, you can find the similar codes in Codes directory, the file name are "LSTM.py" and "emulation.py", after cloning the repository launch "python3 Codes/LSTM.py" to learn a new model, for example.
